This section is grouped by Device to help you quickly find the information you need.

## Help us to help you

When you contact Mycroft for support, we may ask for some of the following information:

* What type of Mycroft **Device** you're using, such as Mark 1, Picroft, KDE Plasmoid and so on
* Whether your **Device** was **Paired**
* Your home.mycroft.ai account details
* Information from your Mycroft logs
* Information generated from the [Support Skill](#using-the-support-skill)

## Using the Support Skill

As of December 2017, we have implemented a [Support Skill](https://github.com/MycroftAI/skill-support) as a core (default) **Skill** on all Mycroft **Devices**. This means that you can generate information about what the **Device** is doing. This information is then emailed to you, so you can review it for privacy reasons, and then if you choose, forward it to Mycroft for support.

To generate information for a Support Ticket, say any of these phrases:

> "Create a support ticket"
> "You're not working!"
> "Send me debug info"

Mycroft will then ask:

`"Please give me a brief description of the problem"`

Tell Mycroft what the problem was, or what you were doing. Mycroft will then compile information and send an email to the address registered to your [home.mycroft.ai](https://home.mycroft.ai) account. The email will contain a link to [Termbin.com](https://termbin.com), with information about your Device, settings, and Skills. This information can be used for troubleshooting.

## About the Mycroft logs

The Mycroft logs each follow a standard format, being:

* A timestamp
* The function or action that was called
* The **level** of the error, which can be one of:

  * DEBUG - incidental information used for debugging purposes
  * INFO - informational log entries which do not indicate an error  
  * WARNING - an error occurred, but it did not stop execution of the **Skill** or process
  * ERROR - an error occurred, and it stopped execution of a **Skill** or other process
  * CRITICAL - a significant error occurred, and it halted execution of the Mycroft functionality itself

### How to find the Mycroft logs

#### Mark 1

  On a Mark 1 **Device**, [first `ssh` into the Mark 1](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/mark-1/#connecting-to-the-mark-1-via-ssh).

  The logs on a Mark 1 are held at `/var/log/`

  To find the specific Mycroft logs, run the following Linux command:

  `ls -las | grep -i Mycroft`

  This command lists all the log files with 'Mycroft' in the file name.

  Example:

  ```
  pi@mark_1:/var/log $ ls -las | grep mycroft
     20 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root    17136 Oct 16 15:52 mycroft-audio.log
  22808 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root 23348347 Oct 17 10:19 mycroft-enclosure-client.log
  38336 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root 39249935 Oct 17 10:19 mycroft-messagebus.log
  24564 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root 25147196 Oct 17 10:19 mycroft-skills.log
     28 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root    23272 Oct 16 15:52 mycroft-speech-client.log
    584 -rw-r--r--  1 root    root   590008 Oct 17 10:00 mycroft-update.log
     84 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root    84493 Oct 16 12:50 mycroft-wifi-setup-client.log
  ```

#### Picroft

On a Raspberry Pi 3 running Picroft, [first `ssh` into the Picroft](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/picroft/#connecting-to-picroft-via-ssh).

The logs on a Picroft are held at `/var/log/` and are named `mycroft-LOGFILE.log`. 

To see all the Picroft logs that are available, use the command `ls -las /var/log/ | grep mycroft`

#### Linux

On a Linux device running Mycroft for Linux, the logs are held at;

`scripts/logs`
relative to where mycroft-core was installed.

```

@TODO Not sure where log files are on Android

## Log file descriptions

### mycroft-audio.log

This log contains information on actions such as:

* When Mycroft loads audio services
* When Mycroft speaks
* When the Text to Speech (TTS) cache is hit
* When volume is increased or decreased

### mycroft-cli.log

This log is primarily used on Linux installations of Mycroft and contains information on actions such as:

* Errors and warnings with Mycroft services

### mycroft-wifi-setup-client.log

Some **Enclosures**, like the Mark 1, will create a WiFi hotspot when they are first set up. This log contains messages related to the creation and tear-down of the WiFi hotspot, as well as errors and information related to clients connecting to the WiFi hotspot.

## General troubleshooting (all Devices)

#### I've made changes to my settings on home.mycroft.ai, but these are not reflected on my **Device**

Have you recently updated your _Location_ or your measurement preferences (ie. kilometers vs miles) in home.mycroft.ai, but these are not reflected on your **Device**?

All **Devices** pull down a local copy of configuration settings from home.mycroft.ai. You may need to instruct your **Device** to pull down your configuration again. To do this, Speak

`hey Mycroft, configuration update`

Mycroft will respond in one of two ways:

* If your configuration was out of date, and has been pulled down again, Mycroft will respond `Your device has been configured`.
* If your configuration was the same on your **Device** as on home.mycroft.ai, Mycroft will respond `Updated configuration`.

If you're comfortable SSHing into your device, SSH in and then run the following commands to see what configuration values are stored locally.

To see the city location value:

`jq ".location.city" < /opt/mycroft/web_config_cache.json`

To see the latitude and longitude coordinates of your location:

`jq ".location.coordinate" < /opt/mycroft/web_config_cache.json`

To see the timezone setting:

`jq ".location.timezone" < /opt/mycroft/web_config_cache.json`

To see the listener setting:

`jq ".listener" < /opt/mycroft/web_config_cache.json`

To see the Speech to Text (STT) settings:

`jq ".stt" < /opt/mycroft/web_config_cache.json`

To see the Text to Speech (TTS) settings:

`jq ".tts" < /opt/mycroft/web_config_cache.json`


We also have [more information available on `mycroft.conf` and `web_config_cache.json` files](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/mycroft-conf/).

## Troubleshooting Mark 1

#### Not connected to the internet

##### If your Mark 1 loses internet connectivity

If your Mark 1 has previously been connected to the internet, and loses internet connectivity, it will speak

`I have lost connection to the internet`

## Troubleshooting Picroft

## Troubleshooting Linux

### Logs state that Python packages are not installed

If your logs have entries like
@TODO example of Python package not being installed

then you may need to reinstall your `virtualenv`. To do this,

* `sudo rm -R ~/.virtualenv/mycroft`
* From the directory where you have cloned `mycroft-core`, run `./dev-setup.sh`. This shell script will re-install any `virtualenv` dependencies that you may be missing.

## Troubleshooting Audio

Mycroft utilizes pulseaudio for sound input and output.  Mycroft uses the default input and output from pulse. Frequent issues include not having the correct mic or speakers set as default. Systems without pulseaudio installed will also not function as expected.

#### Missing pulseaudio:

If you see an issue in the logs with `Popen(play_wav_cmd)` and `OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory` this usually indicates that mycroft can't find pulseaudio. Make sure it's installed and mycroft is able to access it.

#### Microphone can't hear me/CLI show no change in meter while speaking:

If no audio is picked up by mycroft, check the mic to verify it's working.  If the mictest is successful, verify that pulse has your device as the default source.

##### Dev instance audio test:

`start-mycroft.sh audiotest` will attempt to record, then play back a short audio clip using the default source and sink. 

##### Test your speakers:

To test a WAV file, you can use: 
`aplay $WAVfile`

For an MP3/OGG format:
`mpg123 $mp3file`

##### Test your mic:

The following command will start recording for ten seconds on the default input device when run:
`arecord -d 10 -o test.wav`

You can play it back to hear what is recorded with
`aplay test.wav`

### Pulseaudio settings:
##### Show current settings and info

`pactl info`

For mycroft, the lines most relevant are the Default Source: and Default Sink:.

```
  picroft:~$ pactl info
  Server String: unix:/run/user/1000/pulse/native
  Library Protocol Version: 30
  Server Protocol Version: 30
  Is Local: yes
  Client Index: 813
  Tile Size: 65472
  User Name: pi
  Host Name: picroft
  Server Name: pulseaudio
  Server Version: 8.0
  Default Sample Specification: s16le 2ch 44100Hz
  Default Channel Map: front-left,front-right
  Default Sink: alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo
  Default Source: alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo
  Cookie: ab8a:0b4d
```

##### List available input devices

Use `pactl list sinks short` to list devices available to the current user:

```
picroft:~$ pactl list sinks short
1       alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo      module-alsa-card.c      s16le 2ch 44100Hz       SUSPENDED
```

##### List available output devices

`pactl list sources short` will list outputs, or sinks, available to the current user:

```
picroft:~$ pactl list sources short
1       alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor      module-alsa-card.c      s16le 2ch 44100Hz       SUSPENDED
2       alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo       module-alsa-card.c      s16le 2ch 44100Hz       SUSPENDED
```

##### Changing pulseaudio input/output 

If you need to adjust the device you're using for input or output, `pactlset-default-source` (for input) and `pactl set-default-sink` (for output) can be used:
```
$ patcl set-default-source 3
$ pactl set-default-sink 1
```

This would set the default input to be device 3 and the default output device to be 1.  Your numbers will vary.  A succsessful change will not have any additional output listed.  Verify with `pactl info`

##### Other useful commands

`lsusb` can be used to see what USB devices are connected to the system.  `lsusb -v` can be also used, but produces significantly more output.

`groups` will list all the system groups the current user is a part of.  In dev instances of mycroft, can be used to see if the mycroft user is part of the audio group.  If you see null or no input/output devices for the user, use this command to verify if you're part of the `audio` group.

`alsamixer` is a command-line utility to adjust volume and muting of both inputs and outputs. 




## Troubleshooting Skills development

### Skill fails on first run with `ERROR - Failed to load skill`

If you're developing a **Skill**, and run it for the first time, you may encounter an error similar to the below:

```bash
12:30:32.158 - mycroft.skills.core:load_skill:142 - INFO - First run of mycroft-skill-cat-facts
12:30:32.164 - mycroft.skills.core:load_skill:156 - ERROR - Failed to load skill: mycroft-skill-cat-facts
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mycroft_core-0.9.7-py2.7.egg/mycroft/skills/core.py", line 144, in load_skill
    skill.settings.store()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mycroft_core-0.9.7-py2.7.egg/mycroft/skills/settings.py", line 323, in store
    with open(self._settings_path, 'w') as f:
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/opt/mycroft/skills/mycroft-skill-cat-facts/settings.json'
```

The error here is that the file system permission on the **Skill**'s directory are incorrect. The directory should have owner and group permissions of `mycroft:mycroft` as per the below.

```bash
4 drwxr-xr-x  4 mycroft mycroft  4096 Nov 24 14:34 .
4 drwxrwxrwx 38 mycroft mycroft  4096 Nov 27 12:50 ..

```

If your permissions are different to those shown above, change them by running the following commands:

```bash
cd /opt/mycroft/skills/
sudo chown mycroft:mycroft -R your-skill-name
```
