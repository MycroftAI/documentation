# Mycroft Glossary

* **Device** - the platform you have Mycroft installed on. This might be using an **Enclosure**, like the Mark 1, or on a Raspberry Pi, or it might be on a Linux desktop. Each **Device**  needs to be **Paired** with your Mycroft Home account before it can be used.

* **Enclosure** - a hardware implmentation of Mycroft. Examples include the Mark 1 and Picroft.

* **Fallback** - a **Skill** that is designated to be a 'catch-all' when Mycroft cannot interpret the **Intent** from an **Utterance**.

* **Intent** - when a user speaks an **Utterance** to Mycroft, Mycroft tries to interpret the **Intent** of the **Utterance**, and match the **Intent** will a **Skill**.

* **Mark 1** - The Mark 1 device is an **Enclosure** for Mycroft, based on Raspberry Pi. It is designed as a reference hardware device, and is able to be easily modified, hacked and extended. [Mark 1 devices are available in the Mycroft Shop](https://mycroft.ai/shop/?add-to-cart=31440).

* **Registration Code** - a 6-character code that Mycroft issues to you during setup of the Device. This code is needed to [add a Device](../03.your-home.mycroft.ai-account/01.your-home.mycroft-account.md)

* **Skill** - when Mycroft hears the **Wake Word**, then an **Utterance**, Mycroft will try to find a **Skill** that matches the **Utterance**. The **Skill** might fetch some data, or play some audio, or speak, or display some information. If Mycroft can't find a **Skill** that matches the Utterance, he will tell you he doesn't understand.

* **Utterance** - an Utterance is how you interact with Mycroft. An **Utterance** is a command or question -  like "What's the weather like in Kansas City?" or "Tell me about the Pembroke Welsh Corgi".

* **Wake Word** - the Wake Word is the phrase you use to tell Mycroft you're about to issue a command. You can configure your own **Wake Word** in your [Mycroft Home](https://home.mycroft.ai) account.
