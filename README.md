# Mycroft Documentation

## Objective
The purpose of this repo is to unify all the documentation for the public-facing components of Mycroft.AI, and to reduce the fragmentation of documentation.

It is intended that the Markdown in this repo will be consumed by transformation layers or integrations to present the documentation in a user-friendly way.

## Documentation standards

### Conventions

The following conventions are observed in Mycroft documentation:  

* All code is presented `like this`
* All Mycroft-specific terms are **bolded**
* Information is presented in 'inverted pyramid format'. This means an overview is given first, then more detailed information, then more granular information.
* Human-written documentation is done in Markdown, on GitHub
* Documentation of code is done through Google DocStrings format https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Comments and this then passed to documentation generators.


#### Styling conventions

The following conventions are used for styling technical terms and related phrases.

* **internet** is always written in lowercase, never as Internet unless at the start of a sentence.
* **Mark 1** is always styled as such
* **Metadata** is always styled as one word
* **Micro SD card** is always styled as such, not as micro sd card, micro SD card or alternatives
* **Picroft** is always styled as such
*

### Tone of voice

Mycroft documentation is written with the following tone of voice:

* Knowledgeable but never arrogant
* Helpful but encouraging of self-discovery
* Easily readable, but not dumbed down
