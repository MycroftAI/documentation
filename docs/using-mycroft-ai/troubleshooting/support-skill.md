## Using the Support Skill

As of December 2017, we have implemented a [Support Skill](https://github.com/MycroftAI/skill-support) as a core \(default\) **Skill** on all Mycroft **Devices**. This means that you can generate information about what the **Device** is doing. This information is then emailed to you, so you can review it for privacy reasons, and then if you choose, forward it to Mycroft for support.

To generate information for a Support Ticket, say any of these phrases:

> "Create a support ticket" "You're not working!" "Send me debug info"

Mycroft will then ask:

`"Please give me a brief description of the problem"`

Tell Mycroft what the problem was, or what you were doing. Mycroft will then compile information and send an email to the address registered to your [home.mycroft.ai](https://home.mycroft.ai) account. The email will contain a link to [0x0.st](https://0x0.st), with information about your Device, settings, and Skills. This information can be used for troubleshooting.
