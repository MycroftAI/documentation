# Installing New Skills

{% hint style="info" %}
The [Skills Marketplace](https://market.mycroft.ai/skills) is a curated list of Voice Skills that have been tested and approved by the Mycroft Community.
{% endhint %}

## Voice Installation

The simplest way to install a new Skill is to ask Mycroft to do it for you by saying:

> Hey Mycroft, install {skill name}

This will search the Skills Marketplace and install them on your device.

## Removing a Skill

To remove the Skill, you can say:

> Hey Mycroft, uninstall {skill name}

## Command Line

If you prefer to use the command line, you can directly use the [Mycroft Skills Manager](../mycroft-technologies/mycroft-core/msm.md).

To install a Skill run:

```text
$ msm install skill-name
```

To remove a Skill run:

```text
$ msm remove skill-name
```
