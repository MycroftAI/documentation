# Get Mycroft

You can purchase a dedicated Mycroft device, or download Mycroft and run it on your own hardware, be it a Raspberry Pi, computer, or an Android phone.

## Download

You can download Mycroft and run it on your own hardware, be it a Raspberry Pi, computer, or an Android phone.

### Picroft

Picroft is specifically packaged to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 3B+. It is built on top of the official Raspbian Stretch Lite and is available as a disk image ready to be burned to a Micro SD card. For Mycroft to hear you and respond to you, just connect a speaker and a USB microphone to your Pi.

[Get started with Picroft.](picroft.md)

### Mycroft for Linux

If you are a technical user, run Mycroft on your favorite Linux distro, including Ubuntu/Debian, Arch, Fedora. Install it using either a shell script or a standalone installer. There are some installers available for specific platforms, like KDE Plasma.

### Mycroft for Android

Build Mycroft in Android Studio and deploy to your Android devices. We have source code available if you’re comfortable with Android Studio and have the skill set to compile this into an .apk and load onto an Android device.

### Windows and Mac

We’re not quite ready to release Mycroft natively for Windows and macOS. If you are keen to help and have technical experience on these platforms, please let us know!

However you can run Mycroft on MacOS and Windows inside a virtual machine using VirtualBox.

## Buy a device

Get a dedicated device, a voice assistant with no hassles. Plug in, connect to WiFi and go.

### Mark II

Mark II is the next incarnation of Mycroft. It sports a 4-inch display to accompany the voice interaction with a visual interface. Microphone and speaker components have also been updated. Best for those who want a ‘works out of the box’ solution.

You can [reserve your own Mark II](https://mycroft.ai/product/reserve-your-mark-ii-with-a-small-deposit/) with a small deposit.

### Mark 1

Mark 1 is a no-fuss way to get started. It has been designed specifically to work with Mycroft’s capabilities as a standalone device. Great for those who aren’t super technical, but it can be easily extended, altered, modified, and hacked.

_The Mark 1 is currently sold out._
