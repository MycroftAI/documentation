# Legacy Repo

## Legacy repo shout-out

Prior to open-sourcing Mycroft in the mycroft-core.git repo, a number of folks were working on the mycroft.git repo. The commit history was messy, there were some API keys checked in, and we felt it was time for a fresh start. The biggest drawback is the loss of commit/contributor history. This page will at least resolve the latter. Thank you to everyone who helped us get this far!

**Please note that below is a percentage of commits, and not a percentage of contribution value. Everyone below is awesome.**
