# Documentation TODO

The objective of this file is to document the items flagged as @TODO as I go through the documentation so I come back to them


[ ] Mark 1 - how to connect using an ethernet cable
[ ] Mark 1 - what are the limitations around what type of WiFi networks Mark 1 can connect to - for instance, can Mycroft connect to WEP networks, enterprise WPA2-PSK with Radius authentication etc.
[ ] Mark 1 - how to reimage the Device
[ ] Mark 1 - how to keep the Device updated - I've put something in there, but I'm not sure how accurate it is - needs Dev Team to give it the once over.
