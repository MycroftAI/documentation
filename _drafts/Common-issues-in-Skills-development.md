# Common issues in **Skills** development

## I've added new phrases in the .voc file, but Mycroft isn't recognizing them

Compound words like "don't", "won't", "shouldn't" etc. are normalized by Mycroft - so they become "do not", "will not", "should not". You should use the normalized words in your `.voc` files.

@TODO I need more information on issues that Skill developers have
