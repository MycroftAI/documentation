# Getting Mycroft

  * [Mark 1](#mark-1)
  * [Picroft](#picroft)
  * [Mycroft for Linux](#mycroft-for-linux)
  * [Mycroft for Android](#mycroft-for-android)
  * [Windows and Mac](#windows-and-mac)

To get started, choose one of the platforms below

## Mark 1

Order a Mark 1 from our [Shop](https://mycroft.ai/shop), and it will come pre-installed with software. You'll need to set it up, connect it to Wifi and pair it with your [home.mycroft.ai](https://home.mycroft.ai) account.

## Picroft

If you have a Raspberry Pi 3 (older models aren't powerful enough to run Mycroft), and a set of USB speakers and microphone, then you can [download a ready to burn image of Picroft](https://github.com/MycroftAI/enclosure-picroft), burn it to an SD card, and experiment.

## Mycroft for Linux

If you have a popular Linux distro, like Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora or Arch, then you can [download Mycroft for your distro](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/blob/dev/README.md). There are multiple methods of installation, such as via a shell script, or via package, so be sure to follow the documentation.

## Mycroft for Android

If you're familiar with Android Studio, we have a [distribution intended for side loading on to Android devices](https://github.com/MycroftAI/Mycroft-Android). We don't have an .apk available yet.

## Windows and Mac

We don't yet have a build for Windows and Mac, but do subscribe to our newsletter (see the form in the footer below) to stay updated.
