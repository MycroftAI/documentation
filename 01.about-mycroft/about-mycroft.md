# About Mycroft

Welcome to Mycroft.

## What is Mycroft?

Mycroft is the name of a suite of software and hardware tools that use [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) to provide an open source voice assistant.

As of late 2017, Mycroft is undergoing heavy development. It is at a level of maturity where developers and hardware hobbyists will be able to use it effectively. However, it is not yet ready for mainstream adoption.

[This video provides a quick overview](https://youtu.be/m4L0QfzUeEI) of our vision for Mycroft.

Mycroft is modular, and components can be easily 'swapped out'.

Mycroft's key components are:

* **home.mycroft.ai** - the platform where data on **Users** and **Devices** is held
* **Mycroft core** - the core software that provides 'glue' between other modules
* **Mimic** - Mycroft's default text to speech (TTS) engine, based on CMU's Flite (Festival Lite)
* **Adapt Intent Parser** - software which uses machine learning to identify what **Skills** the **User** wants to use - ie. their _intent_
* **Padatious Intent Parser** - software which uses machine learning to identify what **Skills** the **User** wants to use. An alternative to the Adapt Intent Parser.
* **Precise Wake Word Listener** - software which accurately identifies when a **User** has spoken the **Wake Word**
* **Mycroft Skills Management** - a collection of **Skills** that that can be installed on Mycroft **Devices** and **Enclosures**
* **Mark 1** - a software image of Mycroft designed to be installed on the Mycroft Mark 1 - a reference hardware device
* **Picroft** - a software image of Mycroft designed to be installed on Raspberry Pi 3
* **Android** - a software image of Mycroft designed to be installed on Android devices

### Why would you choose to use Mycroft over alternatives such as Amazon™ Alexa™, Google Assistant™, Microsoft Cortana™ or Apple's Siri™?

Great question!

While alternative tools are readily available, and easy to use, they come with some pretty big downsides.

#### Open source

Mycroft is open source. This means that the code used by Mycroft can be inspected, copied, modified, and contributed back to the Mycroft community for everyone to enjoy.

Tools like Amazon™ Alexa™, Google Assistant™, Microsoft Cortana™ or Apple's Siri™ are _black boxes_. That is, you can't look inside them, and see what they do - or importantly - _how_ they do it. And while they may allow you some flexibility to create new **Skills**, these are usually strictly controlled. Mycroft gives you freedom, flexibility and control over how your want _your_ voice assistant to work. Mycroft is AI for _everyone_.

#### Respecting your privacy

Mycroft uses _opt-in privacy_. This means we will only record what you say to Mycroft with your explicit permission. Don't want us to record your voice? No problem! If you'd like us to help Mycroft become more accurate, you can opt in to have your voice anonymously recorded.

#### More hardware, more choices

Mycroft runs on a wide range of software platforms and hardware - meaning that you can run Mycroft on the **Devices** _you_ want. Try Mycroft on a Raspberry Pi, on an Android device - or on your Linux desktop.

#### Lightweight

Mycroft is lightweight, and will run on low-powered hardware, such as the Raspberry Pi 3. So if you're a Hacker, Maker or Hobbyist, it's the perfect platform for low cost experimentation.

#### Community

Mycroft has a vibrant, engaged and
