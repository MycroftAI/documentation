<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help Welcome our New Talent.</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Veilleux joins Mycroft as a Lead Backend Developer with two decades of experience in software engineering. He will oversee the architecture, development and maintenance of the software that doesn’t run on the device, like the APIs, website, and ETL processes.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris, whose last name is pronounced "Vayer" (think Bayer aspirin), grew up on the US east coast in Baltimore, Maryland. He traveled to Columbia, Missouri to pursue a journalism degree at the University of Missouri. After taking an introductory computer science course in his sophomore year, Chris discovered a hidden aptitude for working with computers and decided to change his major. An internship at DST Systems solidified his decision to pursue a career in software engineering. Upon earning his undergraduate degree in computer science in 1996, Chris moved to Kansas City to start his career with DST.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris spent 11 years at DST Systems learning to be an IT professional.  He became an expert in SQL and relational database design. In the last few years of his tenure at DST, Chris was leading three project teams and working on large architecture projects.  During this time he discovered a passion for software architecture. I eventually decided to get out of the mainframe world and into a client/server shop.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>In 2007, a friend of Chris' who worked with him at DST for a time, lured him to a two-year old startup called BATS Trading. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at BATS where Chris learned Python, Javascript, object-oriented programming and service architecture.  He also realized how much he enjoyed working in the entrepreneurial startup atmosphere. After a few years of success as a US stock exchange, BATS expanded to new geographies and asset classes. BATS Trading became BATS Global Markets and eventually went public. While at BATS, Chris wrote a proprietary backend job scheduling application, which allowed his team to streamline the daily cycle of batch jobs.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Chris began working with another startup called Farmobile. The ag-tech company produced a device that extracted operational data from farming equipment with the goal of selling the data and sharing the profits with the farmer.  At Farmobile, Chris led an effort to re-architect the backend code base to improve maintainability. His biggest win at Farmobile was a service that transferred files over cellular network to a device connected the farming equipment. This replaced a "boots on the ground" system where USB drives had to be delivered to farms. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When Chris is not working, he enjoys spending time with his wife and two daughters. Chris' hobbies include photography, playing golf, console gaming, and volunteer tech support at the all-star cheer gym where his daughters are competitive cheerleaders.</span>
