<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kickstarter is over. If you backed a perk with an April delivery you may be wondering, now what?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, we’ve been working hard behind the scenes to get everything in place. We have a partner to help us with fulfillment and we are gearing up to send the surveys. Keep and eye on your inbox, because you’ll receive a survey from Crowd Ox (our fulfillment platform) this week. These surveys verify your purchase, shipping information, and allow you to customize and add to your order. Moreover, your April deliveries are on track!</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How about if you selected a perk that will be delivered in December, now what? You will also be getting a survey from us very soon. You’ll also be able to make changes to your address or add an additional Mark II to your order later. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Add ons? Yep. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also decided to add a few shirts and hats to the list so you can share your support of open source with pride. No pressure, we still love you without a cool new hat. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you are reading this post and you did not get your Mark II on Kickstarter? It’s not too late. We moved over to Indiegogo In Demand, and even have a referral program so you can get Indiegogo credit or a free Mark II! Reserve your reward soon, because we’ll likely have a cutoff for December delivery dates. The survey’s for Indiegogo backers will come out a little later but will be similar to the Kickstarter surveys.</span>
