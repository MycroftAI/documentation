<p>Mycroft now has a Raspberry Pi image that is ready to run.   Developers, makers, hackers and enthusiasts can<a class="piwik_download" href="https://rebrand.ly/Picroft-0_8"> download the image</a> to their Raspberry Pi and create their own Mycroft enabled projects.</p>
<p>We have created the Picroft image so the community has access to a quick, easy to install artificial intelligence(AI).   Our thinking is that having ready access to an out-of-the-box AI will inspire some crazy cool applications.  We're hoping our community proves us right.</p>
<p>This image is specifically designed to run without any configuration on your own Raspberry Pi 2 or 3.  Just plug-in a speaker and a low-cost USB microphone, and you have everything you need to start working on your own voice agent.</p>
<p>You can download a <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/enclosure-picroft">pre-built Picroft 0.8 image</a> that is ready to be burned onto a microSD card for your Raspberry Pi or you can access the components of the project which are hosted on Github in the <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/enclosure-picroft">Picroft repository</a>.</p>

<p>To install Picroft on your Raspberry Pi download the disk image and follow these easy instructions:</p>
<h2>Format the SD Card</h2>
<p>For Windows users (and also those of you with Mac OS X) the tool of choice for writing a Raspberry Pi OS image to SD card is <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/">SD Formatter</a>, from the SD Association. With the card inserted into your computer’s card reader, and ensuring you have the correct <strong>Drive</strong> letter selected in the drop down menu, open the <strong>Option</strong> menu and select <strong>Full (Erase)</strong> and <strong>On</strong>. This ensures that the full capacity of the storage card will be available.</p>

<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>, then <strong>Format</strong> to begin.</p>
<h2>Write the Image to the SD Card</h2>
<p>To write the disk image, use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/">Win32DiskImager</a>, available from Sourceforge. You may need to run with administrator privileges. Select the correct drive letter for your SD card, browse to the image file and click Write to commence the process. Win32DiskImager will inform you when the data has been written.</p>
<h2>First Boot</h2>
<p>We recommend that you connect a monitor and a keyboard to the Raspberry Pi for the first use.  The system is then self-documenting.</p>
