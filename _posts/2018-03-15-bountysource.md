<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the challenges we have here at Mycroft AI is one that many open source development projects face. How do we prioritize Community Development efforts, while at the same time rewarding Community Developers for their time, efforts and contributions? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why we’ve decided to trial <strong>Bountysource</strong>.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Bountysource?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bountysource is a funding platform for open source software, where users can improve the open source projects they love by creating and funding bounties, and by pledging to fundraisers. Developers can also work on Issues they are passionate about, and collect money from bounties from doing so. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this way, Mycroft AI can choose to fund Issues that are of high priority to the organization, but where insufficient internal resources exist to work on the Issue. This also allows our broader Community the option of financially supporting Issues, features or enhancements that are important to them.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I participate? </span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can participate in one of two ways.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post or fund a Bounty</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is a feature, bug or enhancement you really want to to see resolved, you can post this on Bountysource. You can also choose to fund the Bounty. The higher the funding of a Bounty, the more likely it is that a Community Developer will chose to work on the Bounty. Multiple people can join together, and help fund a single Bounty. For instance, if multiple people want the same feature, or want the same Issue resolve, they can join together to make the Bounty higher. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re posting or funding a Bounty, it’s really important that you have clear and unambiguous acceptance criteria for your Issue. That way, it’s straightforward to determine whether the Community Developer has completed the task or not. If you need a </span><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-acceptance-criteria-for-writing-acceptance-criteria-6eae9d497814"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refresher on writing good acceptance criteria, check out this blog post.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A Bounty is represented in Bountysource as a link to a GitHub Issue. So, to create a Bounty, the GitHub Issue must exist first. You can see all the existing Bounties for the Mycroft AI team here: </span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work on an Issue and collect a Bounty</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Community Developer, you can discover Bounties, and work on one, then submit your claim to the Bounty and be rewarded. Different Bounties are worth different amounts - you might for instance - want to work on a few smaller Issues, or bite off a more complex (and rewarding) bigger Issues. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you believe you’ve finished the Issue - by ensuring the Acceptance Criteria are met - you can then claim the Bounty. The poster of the Bounty and contributors then check that the Acceptance Criteria are met, and then you’re awarded the Bounty. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bountysource takes a 10% fee on withdrawals from the platform. So if you claim, and are awarded, a $100 Bounty, it will cost $10 to withdraw it from the platform.</span>
