<p class="p1">We are happy to announce that Mycroft is advancing to the next round of the AI XPRIZE®. The AI XPRIZE is a global competition challenging teams to develop powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI) based applications and demonstrate how humans can collaborate with AIs to tackle the world’s grand challenges.</p>
<p class="p1">Team Mycroft is among 100 teams advancing to the next round of the competition. This puts our community one step closer to the $3M prize purse.</p>
<p class="p1">Why are we competing? Because voice technology is too important to leave locked in the data centers of Silicon Valley. Our team is democratizing vocal computing by building an AI for everyone. Whether you are a small business or a patient suffering from ALS, you’ll be able to benefit from our open source assistant.</p>
<p class="p1">Our XPRIZE entry involves providing a voice assistant that helps to improve the standard of care for patients who are receiving either in-home or institutional medical care. We envision a future where patients can control their environment, receive reminders and coordinate their care with a powerful open voice agent.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ve committed to donating the proceeds of any prizes the Mycroft community receives to open source initiatives around the web.</p>
<p class="p1">We need developers, designers, evangelists, scientists, brand ambassadors and many other skills in order to succeed so if you are interested in helping to improve the state or artificial intelligence and promote an open future for voice, please consider joining our community.</p>
