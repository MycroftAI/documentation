We have received our Arduino Headers and shipped them off to the production facility. These headers allow us to connect our Arduino Pro Mini Board to our custom Main Board. The Arduino Pro powers the LED matrix (mouth) and LED neopixels (eyes) allowing Mycroft to give you feedback on what he is up to through facial expressions.
