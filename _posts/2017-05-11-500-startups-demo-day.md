This is the moment! The entire Mycroft team has assembled from around the globe in sunny San Francisco to support CEO Joshua Montgomery during Demo Day for <a href="https://500.co">500 Startups</a>. This key event is a showcase for investors to discover over 40 exciting new companies.

500 Startups is one of the most respected startup accelerators in the world. Mycroft has worked long and hard to prepare an effective presentation of its innovative open source technology. Team unity is in full effect and group synergy has never been stronger.
